# üåÄ Fanometer


Fanometer is a Python + Opencv program that attempts to measure the RPM (rotations per minute) of a fan using your phone camera feed through DroidCam. It detects motion in a circular area and estimates speed using optical flow calculations.
While it‚Äôs a neat computer vision experiment, it‚Äôs essentially **useless** in practical terms ‚Äî the readings are not accurate and can be easily thrown off by lighting, camera angle, or background movement.

## The Problem Statement

Measuring fan speed usually requires specialized tools like tachometers. Using a camera to calculate RPM might sound cool, but it‚Äôs highly unreliable and error-prone, especially with inconsistent video quality or environmental noise.

---

## The Solution

Fanometer provides a *fun but impractical* way to ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù fan speed by using motion detection inside a selected region of interest. It‚Äôs more of a computer vision demo than an actual tool you can trust for real measurements.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

#### For Software:
- **Languages Used**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: OpenCV, NumPy, Math
- **Tools Used**: DroidCam for streaming phone camera feed to PC

#### For Hardware:
- A phone with DroidCam installed
- A computer capable of running Python + OpenCV
- A fan (any type)


## üì∏ How It Works
1. Connect your phone's camera to your computer using **DroidCam** (Wi-Fi or USB).
2. The script processes the live video feed using **OpenCV**.
3. It applies **Farneback Optical Flow** to detect rotational motion in a circular region.
4. Calculates and displays the **estimated RPM** of the fan.
